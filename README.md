## Abstract
In this project, our goal is to use the data provided by the Yelp, which includes some reviews, tips, business and user information, to do some statistical analysis. Then we need to use a simple and understandable way to provide these business owners with some suggestions to help them improve their performance.

In the github, we have 6 folders in total, they are data, image, slides, code, shiny and summary.

## Data
Since the data size is too big, we put a google drive link and all the data we use in this project have been uploaded on the web.

## Image
In image file, we put all the tables and figures we use in the slides 1, slides 2 and summary report in it.

## Slides
In slides folder, we put 2 presentation slides in it, they are slides 1 and slides 2 in ppt format.

## Code
